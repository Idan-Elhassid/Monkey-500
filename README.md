# Monkey-500
monkey 500 is a Fun-GUI which will choose Great stocks for you to invest in. 
   
the inspiration for this fun project came from graham stephan's youtube video titled: I Spent "$100,000 On A Stock Picking Monkey"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA-P5ilI_Vg

in the video it was stated that: "A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfoli that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts. 

this unique strategy did surprisingly well durring a bull market like in 2021, but less so in a bear market like in 2022.

when run you will be presented with a Tkinter monkey's Gui. upon pressing the "lets go" button a connection to a financial API will be made and random stocks will be chosen for you from the S&P500 index. you will be presented with the stock name, ticker symbol, company field and yesterday's closing price. to choose a new stock press the button again.  

***requirements: install and import the following python libraries: Tkinter, openpyxl, requests, random.

***note the code contains images and xlsx files which are attached as separate files, they need to be saved in the same directory as the .py file

***note that for privecy reasons i have left out of the code my own private api key, for you to use this project you will need your own key. you can get a FREE trial key here:
